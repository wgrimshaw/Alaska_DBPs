## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
getwd()


library(dataRetrieval)

```

```{r cars}
# readNWISsite gives info about a specific site.
site_info <-readNWISsite(siteNumber = c("15297680","15297610", "15072000","15052500"))

Bin1discharge_info <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = "15297680", parameterCd = "00060")
Bin2discharge_info <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = "15297610", parameterCd = "00060")
Bin3discharge_info <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = "15072000", parameterCd = "00060")
 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(readr)
USGSDischargeSitesBin5Final <- read_csv("../DATA/RAW/USGSDischargeSitesBin5Final.csv")
View(USGSDischargeSitesBin5Final)

site_need <-USGSDischargeSitesBin5Final
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
