\textless{}\textbf{General Guidelines}\textgreater{} \textless{}1. Write
in scientific style\textgreater{} \textless{}2.
\href{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html}{Global options for R
chunks} should be set so that only relevant output is
displayed\textgreater{} \textless{}3. Make sure your final knitted PDF
looks professional. Format tables appropriately, size figures
appropriately, make sure bulleted and numbered lists appear as such,
avoid awkwardly placed page breaks, etc.\textgreater{}

\hypertarget{rationale-and-research-questions}{%
\section{Rationale and Research
Questions}\label{rationale-and-research-questions}}

\textless{}Write 1-2 paragraph(s) detailing the rationale for your
study. This should include both the context of the topic as well as a
rationale for your choice of dataset (reason for location, variables,
etc.) A few citations should be included to give context for your topic.
You may choose to configure autoreferencing for your citations or add
these manually.\textgreater{}

\hypertarget{background}{%
\subsection{Background}\label{background}}

The climate is changing, in large part due to anthropogenic carbon
emissions. These changes have different magnitudes around the world and
local impacts of climate change vary as well. Specifically, climate
change is already having greater impacts near the poles than many other
parts of the globe, a process known as polar amplification or arctic
amplification (Serreze et al 2009). Understanding how climate change is
affecting discharge, especially in Alaska, has implications for water
management, ecological processes, and the larger global system (if we
consider ice-albedo feedback). Many communities rely on a given amount
of water from snowmelt to arrive at certain times of the year, so a
shift in the quantity or timing could drastically affect downstream
users and water managers. Additionally, changing the amount of flow in
rivers could affect sensitive biological communities. Furthermore,
changes in temperature that result in glacial or permafrost melting
could reduce the amount of reflective land cover, thus disrupting larger
climate systems.

\textless{}At the end of your rationale, introduce a numbered list of
your questions (or an overarching question and sub-questions). Each
question should be accompanied by one or more working hypotheses,
inserted beneath each question.\textgreater{}

\hypertarget{research-question}{%
\subsection{Research Question}\label{research-question}}

To what degree does climate change affect discharge in Alaskan streams
and rivers?

This guiding question encompasses other questions we seek to answer
through statistical analyses. If climate change is causing average
temperatures to increase, and the magnitude of the increase is greater
at higher latitudes, then higher latitude streams should demonstrate
greater changes in timing and magnitude of peak flows. This study first
seeks to examine if the magnitude of temperature changes increase with
increasing latitude in Alaska. By analyzing historical streamflow
records, we will investigate whether the magnitude of maximum daily
temperature change causes a proportional change in the magnitude and
timing of peak streamflow.

Another aspect of climate change's impacts on streamflow is the
potential of melting permafrost or glaciers. This analysis uses
cumulative annual streamflow and cumulative annual precipitation to
determine if interannual snowpack is melting with increasing average
temperatures. If so, we expect the difference between annual
precipitation and annual streamflow to increase over time.

\newpage

\hypertarget{dataset-information}{%
\section{Dataset Information}\label{dataset-information}}

\textless{}Provide information on how the dataset for this analysis were
collected, the data contained in the dataset, and any important pieces
of information that are relevant to your analyses. This section should
contain much of same information as the metadata file for the dataset
but formatted in a way that is more narrative.\textgreater{}

\hypertarget{discharge}{%
\subsection{Discharge}\label{discharge}}

Discharge data were collected from NWIS using the Data Retrieval
package. The state of Alaska was divided into 10 bins of equal latitude,
and daily discharge data was downloaded for the site in each latitude
bin with the greatest number of samples. This dataset includes the site
location, daily discharge, and county of the site, among other variables
not used in the analysis.

\hypertarget{temperature-and-precipitation}{%
\subsection{Temperature and
Precipitation}\label{temperature-and-precipitation}}

Temperature and precipitation data were downloaded from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Data Online web
portal. As discharge stations do not collect data on temperature and
precipitation, the climate data for each latitude bin were downloaded
from a station in the same county as each selected discharge station. In
each county, daily precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum
temperature, data were downloaded from one station. The criteria for
station selection include data extending to the current date, beginning
at the earliest date, with at least 80\% data coverage. This dataset
also includes site location.

\textless{}Describe how your team wrangled your dataset in a format
similar to a methods section of a journal article.\textgreater{}

\newpage

\hypertarget{data-wrangling}{%
\section{Data Wrangling}\label{data-wrangling}}

\textless{}Add a table that summarizes your data structure (variables,
units, ranges and/or central tendencies, data source if multiple are
used, etc.). This table can be made in markdown text or inserted as a
\texttt{kable} function in an R chunk. If the latter, do not include the
code used to generate your table.\textgreater{}
